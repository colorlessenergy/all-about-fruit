    <h4>hello, there</h4>
    <p>
      You hear it all the time that fruits and veggies can make you more healthy and make you feel good!
      The unfortunate part is that no one tells you why!
      there is a long list of reasons but a few are.
      the high fiber content can help you lower cholesterol which can prevent all diseases that can be caused by high cholesterol.
      Eating fruits and veggies instead of other junk, it can prevent weight gain which can prevent diabetes as well as all other diseases and conditions.
      People donâ€™t just say that fruits and vegetables can prevent diseases just to make money.
      They actually do these things to spread the word.
